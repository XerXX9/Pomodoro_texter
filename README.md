# Pomodoro_texter

## Introduction

This Python script implements a Pomodoro timer with email notifications. The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that helps you break your work into focused intervals (traditionally 25 minutes) separated by short breaks. This script will help you manage your study or work sessions effectively while receiving email notifications for breaks.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following requirements in place:

1. Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Required Libraries: The script uses the `time`, `email.message`, and `smtplib` libraries. You can install these libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install smtplib

# Pomodoro_texter

## Introduction

This Python script implements a Pomodoro timer with email notifications. The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that helps you break your work into focused intervals (traditionally 25 minutes) separated by short breaks. This script will help you manage your study or work sessions effectively while receiving email notifications for breaks.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following requirements in place:

1. Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Required Libraries: The script uses the `time`, `email.message`, and `smtplib` libraries. You can install these libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install smtplib
Gmail Account: You will need a Gmail account to send email notifications. Note that you may need to allow "Less secure apps" on your Gmail account settings.
Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open the pomodoro_timer.py file in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

Modify the following variables to suit your preferences:

user: Your Gmail email address.
pw: Your Gmail password (Note: Storing passwords directly in the script is not secure; consider using environment variables or a configuration file for better security).
askh: The number of hours you want to study.
askm: The number of minutes you want to study.
askbm: The number of minutes for your break.
Save the script.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

Run the script using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python pomodoro_timer.py
Follow the prompts to enter your study and break durations.

The script will display countdown timers and send you an email notification when your break time is up.

Security Note
Storing your email password directly in the script is not recommended for security reasons. Consider using environment variables or a configuration file to store sensitive information.
